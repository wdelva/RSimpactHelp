degree.df.maker(datalist = datalist, survey.time = 10, window.width = 1,
  only.new = TRUE)
}
\description{
\code{degree.df.maker()} creates a table of two columns, "ID" and "degree" from the df dataframe,
 with specific degrees of new relationships and ongoing relationships.
}
\details{
The degree distribution shows the total number of relationships that
 were ongoing (if only.new == FALSE) or that were newly formed (if only.new == TRUE)
 at some time in the survey window.

@param df The dataframe that is produced by \code{\link{agemix.df.maker()}}
 @param survey.time period of the survey or simulation.
 @param window.width period before the end of the survey e.g 1 year before the end of the survey.
 @param only.new  relationships that were newly started during window.width (i.e. the individual
 was NEVER in a relationship with these partners before the start of the window).

@return A dataframe, degree.df that has the columns "ID", "degree".
