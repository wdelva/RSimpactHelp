# Calibration of ABM with phylogenetic tree

# 1. Run a master model with well defined parameter settings

# sexual/transmission network + evolution of the virus across the transmission network
#

# 2. Calibrate the default model with epidmeiological statistics: 2 case

# Ex.1
# input parameters: numrel,diff and eagerness,diff
# target statistics: average relationships for both partners and
# standard deviation  relationships for both partners

# Ex.2 : Chosen
# input parameters: numrel,diff and eagerness,diff
# target statistics: average relationships for men and women,
# standard deviation  relationships for men and women, and average population growth rate


# 3. Calibrate the default model with epidmeiological and phylogenetic statistics: 2 cases

# Ex.1 phylogentic statistics: slope (Alpha) of the fit line between size of sub-trees and the number of sub-trees
# input parameters: numrel,diff and eagerness,diff
# target statistics: average relationships for both partners,
# standard deviation  relationships for both partners, and
# slope of the fit line between size of sub-trees and the number of sub-trees [target stat from a phylogeny]


# Ex.2 phylogentic statistic: slope of the fit line between size of sub-trees and the number of sub-trees, and

# input parameters: numrel,diff and eagerness,diff
# target statistics: average relationships for both partners,
# standard deviation  relationships for both partners, and
# slope of the fit line between size of sub-trees and the number of sub-trees [target stat from a phylogeny]


# Ex.3 phylogentic statistic: slope of the fit line between size of sub-trees and the number of sub-trees
# input parameters: numrel,diff and eagerness,diff
# target statistics: average relationships for both partners,
# standard deviation  relationships for both partners, and
# slope of the fit line between size of sub-trees and the number of sub-trees [target stat from a phylogeny]
