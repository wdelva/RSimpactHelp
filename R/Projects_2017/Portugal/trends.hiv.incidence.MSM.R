# Calibration of ABM with phylogenetic tree

# 1. Run a master model with well deined parameter settings

# sexual/transmission network + evolution of the virus across the transmission network
#

# 2. Calibrate one of the default model with epidmeiological statistics

# input parameters: numrel,diff and eagerness,diff
# target statistics: average relationships for both partners and
# standard deviation  relationships for both partners,

# 3. Calibrate two of the default model with epidmeiological and phylogenetic statistics

# Ex.1 phylogentic statistic: slope of the fit line between size of sub-trees and the number of sub-trees
# input parameters: numrel,diff and eagerness,diff
# target statistics: average relationships for both partners,
# standard deviation  relationships for both partners, and
# slope of the fit line between size of sub-trees and the number of sub-trees [target stat from a phylogeny]


# Ex.2 phylogentic statistic: slope of the fit line between size of sub-trees and the number of sub-trees, and

# input parameters: numrel,diff and eagerness,diff
# target statistics: average relationships for both partners,
# standard deviation  relationships for both partners, and
# slope of the fit line between size of sub-trees and the number of sub-trees [target stat from a phylogeny]
