#' Age difference median
#'
#' Calculate the median age difference at a specified time point,
#' for the supplied age group, stratfied by gender
#'
#' @param df The dataframe that is produced by \code{\link{agedif.df.maker()}}
#' @param agegroup Boundaries of the age group (lower bound <= age < upper bound) that should be retained, e.g. c(15, 30)
#' @param timepoint Point in time at which the age-mixing metrics should be calculated.
#' @param timewindow The length of time before the timepoint for which relationships should be included,
#' e.g. 1, representing one year before the timepoint. This should be a whole number.
#' @param start This is a logical indicating that only relationships starting after the beginning of the window
#' should be used. If start = FALSE relationships could start before the time window.
#'
#' @return a dataframe with median age difference and inter-quartile range(IQR)
#' for the specified time point and age group, overall, and stratified by gender
