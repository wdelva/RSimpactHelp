#' Age-mixing pattern model data.
#'
#' This is an example datalist that could be created from the function
#' \code\link{pattern.modeller}. It contains two elements. The first is a
#' subsetted dataframe of relationships from 15-30 year old men and women that
#' were ongoing during the year prior to year 30 of the simulation. This
#' dataframe includes population-average partner age predictions from a linear
#' mixed effects model. The second element is a dataframe that contains key
#' age-mixing pattern outputs from the model. These outputs can be found in the
#' second dataframe:
#'
#' @format The first dataframe in the list has 16579 rows and 26 variables.
#' The second dataframe has 1 row and 14 variables. More detailed descriptions of
#' the contents of the dataframes can be found in \code\line{pattern.modeller}.
