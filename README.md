# The RSimpactHelper package

<!-- Created by Wim Delva, 21 September 2018 -->


This repository contains R functions that facilitate post-simulation analysis in R of simulation output for models developed with SimpactCyan (<https://simpactcyan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>). 


## SYSTEM AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

### Operating system

  We have only tested this code on personal computers (OS X Version 10.11.6 and Linux Ubuntu Version 16.04), and on the lengau cluster at the Cape Town Centre for High Performance Computing (CHPC) and the golett cluster of the Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC).

### Required software

  R version 3.4.4

  Seq-Gen version 1.3.4. <https://github.com/rambaut/Seq-Gen/releases/tag/1.3.4> Simulates viral evolution across a transmission network.

  FastTree version 2.1.10. <http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/#Install> Reconstructs a phylogenetic tree from a large alignment dataset.
