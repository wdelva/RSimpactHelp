\usage{
sequence.simulation.seqgen(dir.seq = dir, seq.gen.tool = "seq-gen",
  datalist = datalist, seeds.num = 123, endpoint = 40,
  limitTransmEvents = 3, hiv.seq.file = "hiv.seq.C.pol.j.fasta")
}
\arguments{
\item{dir.seq}{Direcotry where the simulations of sequence will be performed, thre might be compiled seq-gen tool}

\item{seq.gen.tool}{Name of the file for compiled seq-gen}

\item{datalist}{The datalist that is produced by \code{\link{readthedata()}}}

\item{seeds.num}{Seed number for reproducability}

\item{endpoint}{Only transmission events that took place before this point in simulation time}

\item{limitTransmEvents}{Minimum number of individuals in that transmission network (one transmission network per HIV seeding individual)}

\item{hiv.seq.file}{File containing seed HIV sequences in FASTA format, it might be in same repository as seq-gen}
}
\value{
Files of sequences data, sampling dates, and transmission trees
