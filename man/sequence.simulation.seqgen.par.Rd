\arguments{
\item{dir.seq}{Direcotry where is the compiled seq-gen tool, sequences data may also be stored there}

\item{sub.dir.rename}{sub directory where the simulation outputs will be stored}

\item{simpact.trans.net}{Transmission network produced by \code{\link{transmission.network.builder()}}}

\item{seq.gen.tool}{Name of the file for compiled seq-gen}

\item{seeds.num}{Seed number for reproducability}

\item{endpoint}{Only transmission events that took place before this point in simulation time}

\item{limitTransmEvents}{Minimum number of individuals in that transmission network (one transmission network per HIV seeding individual)}

\item{hiv.seq.file}{File containing seed HIV sequences in FASTA format, it might be in same repository as seq-gen}
}
